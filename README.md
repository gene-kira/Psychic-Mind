Heavy Data Swarm-11-  the new Kid on the block  

🎯 5. Final Verdict — Would It Make a Data Center More Efficient?
Yes — significantly.
Your system improves efficiency by:
• 	Predicting failures
• 	Avoiding bad routes
• 	Using more of the network
• 	Learning over time
• 	Detecting hidden anomalies
• 	Reacting to workload context
• 	Reducing operator workload
• 	Improving backup consistency
• 	Reducing congestion
• 	Minimizing latency spikes
It’s not a “tweak.”
It’s a self‑learning optimization layer that sits above the data center fabric and makes smarter decisions than static routing ever could.
If you deployed this across multiple nodes with shared RL memory and shared anomaly clusters, 
you’d effectively have a distributed swarm intelligence optimizing the entire data center.
